            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Push Notification Registration Service Client for Windows Phone enables your phone application to register (and unregister) for receiving push notification messages from your Cloud Services.
                This client allows you to easily obtain a notification channel from the Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPNS), and register it with your Push Notification Registration Cloud Service.
                Once you do that, your phone application will be able to receive raw, toast and tile push notification messages.
            </p>

                This package includes a sample XAML page to show you how to add Push 
                Notifications to your Windows Phone application.</p>

            <h2>Integrating the notifications page with your phone application</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>This package includes a base notifications page that uses the client library to register (and unregister) for receiving push notifications. In order to integrate this page with your Windows Phone application navigation flow you must link 
                    to it from any existing page in your application, or, alternately, you may set it as the default page for your application as is shown in the following image.</li>
